# Quantum_Control
Matlab codes for finding optimal control waveforms.

Each folder is for different physical system. The main function is called 'trial_opt.m' . It calls functions like 'Hamiltonian.m','fidelity.m'. One can edit these files to include desired Hamiltonian and corresponding fidelity and gradient.
